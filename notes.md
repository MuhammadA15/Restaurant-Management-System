# Usability Tests
There are many tests out there and this will introduce you to several ...


1. Questionnaires
    * Contain various questions that you come up with in regards to your interface
    * They are easy to repeat and can find user preferences
    * However pilot work may be needed to prevent misunderstandings and it may be hard to receive all of the Questionnaires back
    * Suggested number for significant results: at least 30 people ~Usability engineering textbook by Jacob Wilson~


1. Interviews
    * These are flexible and can be more or less in-depth depending on the person
    * However, they are time consuming and can be hard to compare from interview to interview
    * Suggested number for significant results: 5

1. Observation
    * Observation is bery good in revealing how the user actually goes about performing tasks including what functions and features that they use
    * However, appointments may be hard to set up and the experimenter does not have much control as they are silently observing the user
    * Suggested Number for significant results: 3 or more

1. Thinking Aloud
    * Thinking aloud method involves observing users and asking them to 'think aloud'
    * This test is good at pinpointing user misconceptions and is a cheap tests
    * however it may feel unnatural
    * Suggested number for significant results: 3-5

1. Performance measurement
    * Various things may be measured
    * this can provide hard results
    * however, it does not pinpoint individual Usability usage
    * Suggested number for significant results: 10

1. Heuristic Evaluation
    * This is a collection of usability guidlines to help a user to evaluate Usability
    * on a scale of 10
    * Suggested number for significant results: 5 users find 80% of tests

        * Do they need to read one or is the interface intuitive enought
        * Does the Documentation allow users to quickly find what they were searching for
